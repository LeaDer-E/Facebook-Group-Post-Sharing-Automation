## Description

This script performs the following tasks:
- Launches a Chrome browser using undetected_chromedriver to help bypass automation detection.
- Loads browser data (cookies and user agent) to facilitate logging in without requiring credentials repeatedly.
- Logs into Facebook using the provided credentials.
- Waits for the user to manually navigate to and open the desired post.
- Reads the post content from the file `post.txt`.
- Opens the share window and selects groups from the list.
- Shares the post in each group, starting from the specified group number.
- Uses multiple XPath expressions to accommodate differences in Facebook's interface.

## Code Explanation
The script relies on libraries like selenium and undetected_chromedriver to control a Chrome browser and avoid detection by Facebook. It includes the following steps:
* Browser Setup: Initializes Chrome with options to avoid detection, such as disabling automation-controlled features and setting a natural user agent.
* Data Saving and Loading: Saves cookies and browser data to a JSON file for faster future logins.
* Login: Prompts the user for credentials and uses them to log into Facebook.
* Post Identification: Asks the user to manually open the desired post, then reads the sharing message from post.txt.
* Post Sharing: Identifies available groups, allows the user to choose a starting point, and automatically shares the post to each group using predefined XPaths.
* Error Handling: Includes mechanisms to handle errors such as missing page elements or publishing issues.

   * The group number from which you want to start sharing (e.g., 1 for the first group).
3. The script will automatically open a Chrome browser and log into Facebook.
4. Manually navigate to your profile and open the desired post.
5. Press Enter to continue once the post is open.
6. The script will start sharing the post to the selected groups one by one.
7. A success message will be displayed after each group, and a final message will confirm the process is complete.

## Warning
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
* Make sure to use the script legally and in accordance with Facebook's policies. Posting random content may result in your account being banned.

## Additional Notes
### üí¨ Additional Notes
* This code uses undetected_chromedriver, which might require updates depending on the latest version of Chrome or changes in Facebook policies.
* Keep an eye on any updates to the libraries used to ensure smooth operation.

## Notes
* Important: If the number of groups you intend to use this script for is less than 10, it is recommended to post manually. There is no need to use the script in such cases.
